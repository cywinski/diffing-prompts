</role>

<task_context>
The user has reviewed their code changes and wants to commit and push them. You should:
1. Check what files have been modified
2. Generate an appropriate conventional commit message
3. Commit and push the changes
</task_context>

## Instructions

<instructions>
1. **Check Git Status**
   <status_check>
   Run `git status` to see:
   - Modified files
   - Untracked files
   - Current branch
   </status_check>

2. **Analyze Changes**
   <analysis>
   For modified files:
   - Read the files to understand what changed
   - Determine the type of change (feat, fix, docs, exp, refactor, etc.)
   - Identify the main component or feature affected
   </analysis>

3. **Generate Commit Message**
   <commit_message>
   Use conventional commit format:
   - `feat:` - New feature or experiment
   - `fix:` - Bug fix
   - `exp:` - Experiment results or updates
   - `docs:` - Documentation changes
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `test:` - Adding or updating tests
   - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

   Format:
   ```
   <type>: <short description>

## Best Practices

<best_practices>
1. **Review First**: Always check git status before committing
2. **Be Specific**: Include details about what changed in the commit body
3. **Use Conventional Format**: Makes git history easy to scan
4. **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent one logical change
5. **Push Immediately**: Keep remote in sync with local changes
</best_practices>

Remember: Good commit messages tell the story of your project's evolution. Make them clear and informative.
