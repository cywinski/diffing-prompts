# Configuration for calculating KL divergence from stored logprobs data
# No model loading required - uses pre-computed top-k logprobs from both models

# Directory containing response files from model 1 with logprobs
# Each response file should contain top-k logprobs in the format:
#   responses[i].choices[0].logprobs.content[j]:
#     - token: the token string
#     - logprob: the logprob for this token
#     - top_logprobs: list of {token, logprob} dicts for top-k alternatives
responses_dir_model1: "/workspace/projects/diffing-prompts/experiments/results/responses_openrouter/chatgpt-4o-2024-05-13"

# Directory containing response files from model 2 with logprobs
# Should have same structure as model 1 files, matched by prompt index
responses_dir_model2: "/workspace/projects/diffing-prompts/experiments/results/responses_openrouter/chatgpt-4o-latest"

# Output directory for KL divergence results
output_dir: "/workspace/projects/diffing-prompts/experiments/results/kl_4o"
