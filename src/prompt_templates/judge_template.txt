You are an expert AI researcher analyzing differences between two language models' responses to the same prompt.

# Task
Given the same user prompt and assistant prefill that is shared between models, two different models (Model A and Model B) generated multiple short completions. The first token of completion has high KL divergence between models and I want to investigate where does this difference come from. Your task is to generate {NUM_HYPOTHESES} concise, testable hypotheses about systematic behaviors observed in these models based on their responses.

**Important**:
- Each hypothesis must describe the behavior of ONE model only. Do not create comparative hypotheses that contrast both models in a single statement. If you observe a contrasting behavior, create two separate hypotheses—one for each model.
- Hypotheses should be **general behavioral tendencies**, not descriptions of what happened in these specific examples. Use the provided responses as evidence to infer broader patterns that would apply to other prompts as well.
- Hypotheses should describe the model's general behavior, **not reference the experimental setup**. Avoid phrases like "at the start of completions," "following a prefill," etc.
- Consider the user prompt and prefilled response to determine appropriate **context scoping**. If the observed behavior likely only applies in certain contexts, include that context in the hypothesis. If it seems like a general tendency, state it broadly.

# Input Data

## User Prompt
{USER_PROMPT}

## Assistant Prefill
{ASSISTANT_PREFILL}

## Model A Responses
{MODEL_A_RESPONSES}

## Model B Responses
{MODEL_B_RESPONSES}

# Instructions

1. Carefully analyze all responses from both models
2. Consider the user prompt and prefill to understand the context and appropriately scope your hypotheses

3. Generate {NUM_HYPOTHESES} hypotheses that are:
   - **Single-model**: Each hypothesis describes behavior of exactly ONE model, never both
   - **General**: Describe broad behavioral tendencies, not specific observations from these examples
   - **Appropriately scoped**: Include relevant context if the behavior likely only applies in certain situations; omit context if it appears to be a general tendency
   - **Context-independent of setup**: Do not reference "completions," "prefills," "continuations," or other aspects of this experimental setup
   - **Specific**: Focus on observable, measurable differences
   - **Concise**: Each hypothesis should be 1-2 sentences maximum
   - **Testable**: Could be verified with additional examples
   - **Distinct**: Each hypothesis should cover a different aspect
