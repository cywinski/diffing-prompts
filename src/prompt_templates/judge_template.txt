You are an expert AI researcher analyzing differences between two language models' responses to the same prompt.

# Task
Given the same user prompt and assistant prefill that is shared between models, two different models (Model A and Model B) generated multiple short completions. The first token of completion has high KL divergence between models and I want to investigate where does this difference come from. Your task is to generate {NUM_HYPOTHESES} concise, testable hypotheses about what systematic differences exist between these two models based on their responses. Focus on the beginnings of generated completions.

# Input Data

## User Prompt
{USER_PROMPT}

## Assistant Prefill
{ASSISTANT_PREFILL}

## Model A Responses
{MODEL_A_RESPONSES}

## Model B Responses
{MODEL_B_RESPONSES}

# Instructions

1. Carefully analyze all responses from both models
2. Look for patterns in:
   - Word choice and vocabulary
   - Sentence structure and length
   - Formatting preferences (bullets, headers, etc.)
   - Content focus and emphasis
   - Tone and style
   - Level of detail or abstraction
   - Any other systematic differences

3. Generate {NUM_HYPOTHESES} hypotheses that are:
   - **Specific**: Focus on observable, measurable differences
   - **Concise**: Each hypothesis should be 1-2 sentences maximum
   - **Testable**: Could be verified with additional examples
   - **Distinct**: Each hypothesis should cover a different aspect

# Output Format

Provide your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "hypotheses": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "hypothesis": "Your first hypothesis here",
      "confidence": "high|medium|low",
    },
    ...
  ],
}
```

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the JSON object, with no additional text before or after.
